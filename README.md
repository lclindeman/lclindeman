I'm the editor and strategist for [github.blog](https://github.blog/), typing this from my home office in the Atlanta, Georgia area :peach:. Before joining GitHub, I managed the engineering blog and social media handles at Salesforce. I work hard to build community and to bring people together around their shared love of using technology to solve problems. I believe that words matter, and I'm passionate about crafting them. I am always reading a book :book: and also enjoy hiking and backpacking :mountain: with my husband :couple_with_heart_woman_man:. I take far too many pictures of my cat :black_cat: and love to talk about the Oxford comma.
